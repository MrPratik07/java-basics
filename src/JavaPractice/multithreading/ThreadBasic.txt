MULTITHREADING AND CONCEPTS

1. Concurrency in Java
this refers to multiple task or threads running at a same time simultaneously for better and efficient
execution

2. Thread
Thread is a smallest unit of a program that can be executed independently. Java programs are inherently single
threaded but it can multi-threaded and run in parallel

3.Process vs Thread
Process : An executing instance of a program
Thread : lightWeight unit of a process, single process can have multiple threads

4. Thread LifeCycle
New, Runnable, Blocked, waiting, time waiting, terminated

5. Creating Threads
  a. Extending Thread class
  b. implementing Runnable interface

6. Executor Service
A more advanced and flexible way to manage threads in Java is through the Executor framework,
especially ExecutorService. This allows for managing a pool of threads efficiently.

7 Synchronization
To avoid issues with data being corrupted when multiple threads access shared resources,
you need to control access using synchronization.
